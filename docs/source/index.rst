Welcome to Pyecog's documentation!
==================================

Pyecog is a python module and gui to facilitate the detection and annotation of epileptiform activity from *single* (currently)
channel intracranial EEG or ECoG recordings.

It is currently under quite heavy construction! I am currently working on a major update that fixes a number of bugs and extends functionality,
but until then this is the documentation for the current version.

Note! Please use the "Development" version. For more details see installation instructions.
